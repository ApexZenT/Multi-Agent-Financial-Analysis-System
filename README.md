# Multi-Agent Financial Analysis System

A modular **AI-powered multi-agent system** designed to perform intelligent financial analysis by coordinating multiple specialised agents. The system enables structured reasoning, scalability, and efficient financial insight generation by decomposing complex tasks into agent-driven workflows.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**
  - Multiple autonomous agents collaborate to perform data analysis, reasoning, and insight synthesis.
  - Each agent handles a specific responsibility, improving clarity and extensibility.

- **Model Flexibility**
  - Currently utilises **GPT4All** due to local memory constraints.
  - The architecture is **model-agnostic** and allows easy replacement with other LLMs (OpenAI, HuggingFace, or custom models) based on available resources.

- **Modular & Scalable Design**
  - Agents can be added, removed, or modified independently.
  - Suitable for experimentation, research, and real-world financial workflows.

- **Financial Data Analysis**
  - Supports structured datasets (CSV, tabular data).
  - Designed for trend analysis, forecasting, and financial decision support.

- **Improved Interpretability**
  - Distributed reasoning across agents enhances transparency compared to monolithic models.

- **Developer-Friendly**
  - Clean project structure with reusable components.
  - Easy integration with new data sources or analytical pipelines.
